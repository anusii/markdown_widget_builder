## Example Usage of MarkdownWidgets

See (lib/main.dart) for a simple example.

Run it with:

```
cd example
flutter create .
flutter run
```

If you want to test submitting the form results to the server via
POST, please run `make server` first. The server requires python
installed and the python packages flask and flask_cors installed.
